pellescc gcc-style compiler frontend for PellesC 8
--------------------------------------------------

PellesC 8 is the last 32bit release of PellesC, which is an astonishingly
good compiler, which in my experience beats mingw.

this compiler driver serves as a gcc-style frontend to the compiler,
assembler and linker so pellesC can be used via wine from standard
unix configure scripts.

read the header of pellescc.c for the specific setup and examples.

PellesC 8.0 is no longer directly offered as a download from the PellesC
homepage, but you can find it [here](http://www.smorgasbordet.com/pellesc/800/setup.exe).
